    <h3>What These Metrics Mean</h3>
    <div class="mt-8" style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.8;">
        <p><strong>Reporting Time Eliminated</strong> — Each flagged shipment is one you don't need to manually research. At ~3 minutes per exception, the platform saves real operator time every day.</p>
        <p class="mt-8"><strong>Delay Detection Speed</strong> — The platform evaluates every shipment on load. Pre-pilot, delays were caught manually, often 48+ hours late. Now they surface immediately.</p>
        <p class="mt-8"><strong>Status Questions Reduced</strong> — Every visible exception on the dashboard is an email or Teams message that doesn't need to be sent. Self-service visibility replaces reactive communication.</p>
        <p class="mt-8"><strong>Exception Coverage</strong> — 100% of loaded shipments are evaluated against configurable thresholds. No manual spot-checking, no gaps.</p>
    </div>

<div class="detail-card mt-16">
    <h3>Pilot Tracking Approach</h3>
    <div class="mt-8" style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.8;">
        <p>These metrics are designed to be reviewed weekly during the pilot period. Track them in a simple spreadsheet alongside:</p>
        <ul style="margin: 8px 0 0 20px;">
            <li>Number of vendor follow-ups triggered by the platform</li>
            <li>Corrections to exception flags (false positives)</li>
            <li>User feedback from operators</li>
            <li>Threshold adjustments made and why</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-8">The goal is not perfect data on day one. The goal is: <strong>"Is this better than what we had yesterday?"</strong></p>
